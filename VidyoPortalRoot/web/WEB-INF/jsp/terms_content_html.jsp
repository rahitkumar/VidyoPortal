</p>
<p>Conditioned
    upon compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
    Vidyo grants to Customer a nonexclusive and nontransferable license
    to use for Customer's internal business purposes the Software and the
    Documentation for which Customer has paid the required license fees.
    &quot;Documentation&quot; means written information (whether
    contained in user or technical manuals, training materials,
    specifications or otherwise) specifically pertaining to the Software
    and made available by Vidyo with the Software in any manner
    (including on CD-Rom, or on-line). Customer's license to use the
    Software shall be limited to, and Customer shall not use the Software
    in excess of, a single Vidyo Product as set forth in the applicable
    purchase order which has been accepted by Vidyo and for which Vidyo
    has been paid the required license fee.  Unless otherwise expressly
    provided in the Documentation, Customer shall use the Software solely
    as embedded in, for execution on, or (where the applicable
    documentation permits installation on non-Vidyo equipment) for
    communication with Vidyo equipment owned or leased by Customer and
    used for Customer's internal business purposes. No other uses of the
    Software are authorized by this Agreement and any unauthorized use of
    the Software shall be a violation of the terms of this license and
    Agreement.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Note
    For evaluation or beta copies for which Vidyo does not charge a
    license fee, the above requirement to pay license fees does not
    apply.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>Use
    of Products</u>.  Products are not authorized for use in critical
    safety or other applications where any failure may reasonably be
    anticipated to result in bodily injury, loss of life, or catastrophic
    damage to property.  If Customer uses or sells the Products for use
    in any such applications, Customer acknowledges that such sale or use
    is at Customer's sole risk.   Customer will indemnify, defend and
    hold Vidyo and its suppliers and licensors harmless from and against
    any and all liabilities and costs arising out of or in connection
    with such sale or use.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>Limited
    Warranty </u>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>Express
    Warranty</u> - Vidyo warrants that for a period of one (1) year
    following shipment of the Product: (i) the Product hardware shall be
    free from defects in materials and workmanship and (ii) the Licensed
    Software substantially conforms to its published specification.  For
    instructions to make and process claims under this warranty, please
    contact the Vidyo authorized reseller from whom you acquired the
    Product.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Except
    for the foregoing, the Software is provided AS IS. This limited
    warranty extends only to the Customer who is the original licensee.
    Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and the entire liability of
    Vidyo and its suppliers and licensors under this limited warranty
    will be, at Vidyo's option, repair, replacement, or refund of the
    Product if reported (or, upon request, returned) to Vidyo or the
    party supplying the Product to Customer. In no event does Vidyo
    warrant that the Software is error free or that Customer will be able
    to operate the Software without problems or interruptions. In
    addition, due to the continual development of new techniques for
    intruding upon and attacking networks, Vidyo does not warrant that
    the Software or any equipment, system or network on which the
    Software is used will be free of vulnerability to intrusion or
    attack.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>Restrictions</u>.
    This warranty does not apply if the Software, Product or any other
    equipment upon which the Software is authorized to be used (a) has
    been altered, except by Vidyo or its authorized representative, (b)
    has not been installed, operated, repaired, or maintained in
    accordance with instructions supplied by Vidyo, (c) has been
    subjected to abnormal physical or electrical stress, misuse,
    negligence, or accident; or (d) is licensed, for beta, evaluation,
    testing or demonstration purposes. This warranty also does not apply
    to (e) any temporary Software modules; (f) any Software for which
    Vidyo does not receive a license fee.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><u>DISCLAIMER
    OF WARRANTY </u>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>EXCEPT
    AS SPECIFIED IN THIS WARRANTY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
    REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
    IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY,
    NON-INTERFERENCE, ACCURACY OF INFOR-MATIONAL CONTENT, OR ARISING FROM
    A COURSE OF DEALING, LAW, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, ARE HEREBY
    EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND ARE EXPRESSLY
    DISCLAIMED BY VIDYO, ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS.  TO THE EXTENT AN
    IMPLIED WARRANTY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN
    DURATION TO THE EXPRESS WARRANTY PERIOD. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR
    JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED
    WARRANTY LASTS, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY. THIS WARRANTY
    GIVES CUSTOMER SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND CUSTOMER MAY ALSO HAVE
    OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. This
    disclaimer and exclusion shall apply even if the express warranty set
    forth above fails of its essential purpose.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>General
    Limitations</u>.
</p>
<p>This
    is a license, not a transfer of title, to the Software and
    Documentation, and Vidyo and/or its suppliers and licensor(s),
    retain(s) ownership of all copies of the Software and Documentation
    and intellectual property rights of the Product and Software.
    Customer acknowledges that the Products, Software and Documentation
    contain intellectual property rights (such as international and
    United States trade secrets, copyrights, patents, and patents
    pending) of Vidyo, its suppliers or licensors including but not
    limited to the specific internal design and structure of individual
    programs and associated interface information. Accordingly, except as
    otherwise expressly provided under this Agreement, Customer shall
    have no right and Customer specifically agrees not to: (i) transfer,
    assign or sublicense its license rights to any other person or
    entity, or use the Software on unauthorized or secondhand Vidyo
    equipment, and Customer acknowledges that any attempted transfer,
    assignment, sublicense or use shall be void; (ii) make error
    corrections to or otherwise modify or adapt the Product, Software or
    create derivative works based upon the Software, or permit third
    parties to do the same; (iii) reverse engineer or decompile, decrypt,
    disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software to human-readable form,
    except to the extent otherwise expressly required to be permitted
    under applicable law notwithstanding this restriction and subject to
    the requirements thereof; (iv) use or permit the Software to be used
    to perform services for third parties, whether on a rental, service
    bureau or time-sharing basis or otherwise, without the express
    written authorization of Vidyo; or (v) disclose, provide, or
    otherwise make available trade secrets contained within the Products,
    Software and Documentation in any form to any third party without the
    prior written consent of Vidyo. Customer shall implement reasonable
    security measures to protect such trade secrets. To the extent
    required by law, and at Customer's written request, Vidyo shall
    provide Customer with the interface information needed to achieve
    interoperability between the Software and another independently
    created program, on payment of Vidyo's applicable fee, if any.
    Customer shall observe strict obligations of confidentiality with
    respect to such information and shall use such information in
    compliance with any applicable terms and conditions upon which Vidyo
    makes such information available.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Unless
    otherwise expressly specified all taxes and duties relating to this
    Agreement, the Products, or Software are excluded and shall be
    Customer's responsibility.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>Software,
    Upgrades and Additional Copies</u>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For
    purposes of this Agreement, &quot;Software&quot; shall include (and
    the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to) computer
    programs, including firmware, as provided to Customer by Vidyo or an
    authorized Vidyo reseller, and any upgrades, updates, bug fixes or
    modified versions thereto (collectively, &quot;Upgrades&quot;) or
    backup copies of the Software licensed or provided to Customer by
    Vidyo or an authorized Vidyo reseller. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER
    PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT: (1) CUSTOMER HAS NO LICENSE OR RIGHT TO
    USE ANY ADDITIONAL COPIES OR UPGRADES UNLESS CUSTOMER, AT THE TIME OF
    ACQUIRING SUCH COPY OR UPGRADE, ALREADY HOLDS A VALID LICENSE TO THE
    ORIGINAL SOFTWARE AND HAS PAID THE APPLICABLE FEE FOR THE UPGRADE OR
    ADDITIONAL COPIES; (2) USE OF UPGRADES IS LIMITED TO VIDYO EQUIPMENT
    FOR WHICH CUSTOMER IS THE ORIGINAL END USER PURCHASER OR LESSEE OR
    WHO OTHERWISE HOLDS A VALID LICENSE TO USE THE SOFTWARE WHICH IS
    BEING UPGRADED; AND (3) THE MAKING AND USE OF ADDITIONAL COPIES IS
    LIMITED TO NECESSARY BACKUP PURPOSES ONLY.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>Proprietary
    Notices</u>. Customer agrees to maintain and reproduce all copyright
    and other proprietary notices on all copies, in any form, of the
    Software in the same form and manner that such copyright and other
    proprietary notices are included on the Software. Except as expressly
    authorized in this Agreement, Customer shall not make any copies or
    duplicates of any Software without the prior written permission of
    Vidyo.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>Term
    and Termination</u>. This Agreement and the license granted herein
    shall remain effective until terminated as specified in the related
    order or under this section. Customer may terminate this Agreement
    and the license any time by destroying all copies of Software and any
    Documentation. Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate
    immediately without notice from Vidyo if Customer fails to comply
    with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer
    shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its
    possession or control. All confidentiality obligations of Customer
    and all limitations of liability and disclaimers and restrictions of
    warranty shall survive termination of this Agreement. In addition,
    the provisions of the sections titled &quot;United States Government
    Restricted Rights.&quot; and &quot;General Terms Applicable to the
    Limited Warranty Statement and End User License&quot; shall survive
    termination of this Agreement. Any other clauses which by their terms
    are required for the enforcement of this Agreement shall survive
    termination.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>Export</u>.
    Products, Software and Documentation, including technical data, may
    be subject to U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export
    Administration Act and its associated regulations, and may be subject
    to export or import regulations in other countries. Customer agrees
    to comply strictly with all such regulations and acknowledges that it
    has the responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or
    import Products, Software and Documentation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>United
    States Government Commercial License Rights</u>.</p>
<p>This
    section applies only if Customer is a United States Government
    entity.&nbsp; The Software and Documentation qualify as "commercial
    items" consisting of "commercial computer software" and
    "computer software documentation" as such terms are defined and
    used at FAR (48 C.F.R.) 2.101 and FAR 12.212. Customer agrees to be
    bound by this Agreement, except for any provisions that are contrary
    to Federal law, and further agrees that any provisions that are
    contrary to Federal law will be read out of this Agreement without
    impacting the validity and enforceability of any other provisions of
    this Agreement.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><u>General
    Terms Applicable to the End User License </u>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>Limited
    Warrant Statement and Disclaimer of Liabilities</u>. REGARDLESS
    WHETHER ANY REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR
    OTHERWISE, IN NO EVENT WILL VIDYO OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE
    LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT, OR LOST OR DAMAGED DATA,
    BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF CAPITAL, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
    CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND
    REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY OR WHETHER ARISING OUT OF THE
    USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE AND EVEN IF VIDYO OR
    ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES. In no event shall Vidyo's or its suppliers' or
    licensors' liability to Customer, whether in contract, tort
    (including negligence), breach of warranty, or otherwise, exceed the
    price paid by Customer for the Software that gave rise to the claim
    or if the Software is part of another Vidyo Product, the price paid
    for such other Vidyo Product. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO
    NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL
    DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>Customer
    agrees that the limitations of liability and disclaimers set forth
    herein will apply regardless of whether Customer has accepted the
    Software or any other product or service delivered by Vidyo. Customer
    acknowledges and agrees that Vidyo has set its prices to end users
    and to Vidyo's authorized resellers and entered into this Agreement
    in reliance upon the disclaimers of warranty and the limitations of
    liability set forth herein, that the same reflect an allocation of
    risk between the parties (including the risk that a contract remedy
    may fail of its essential purpose and cause consequential loss), and
    that the same form an essential basis of the bargain between the
    parties. The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement
    shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
    State of New Jersey, United States, without reference to or
    application of choice of law rules or principles. The exclusive venue
    for any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be within the
    competent courts in the State of New Jersey, USA. The United Nations
    Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.  If
    any portion hereof is found to be void or unenforceable, the
    remaining provisions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and
    effect.   Except as expressly provided herein or otherwise expressly
    agreed by Vidyo, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
    between the parties with respect to the terms herein and
    Documentation and supersedes any conflicting or additional terms
    contained in any purchase order or elsewhere, all of which terms are
    excluded. This Agreement has been written in the English language,
    and the parties agree that the English version will govern.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>Infringement
    Indemnification</u>.  (a) Vidyo will defend or settle, at its
    expense, any action brought against Customer based upon the claim
    that the Software or Product, if used within the scope of the license
    granted under this Agreement, directly infringe a registered United
    States, European Union or Commonwealth patent or copyright; provided,
    however, that: (i) Customer shall notify Vidyo promptly in writing of
    any such claim; (ii) Customer shall not enter into any settlement or
    compromise any claim without Vidyo's prior written consent; (iii)
    Vidyo shall have sole control of any such action and settlement
    negotiations; and (iv) Customer shall provide Vidyo with information
    and assistance, at Vidyo's request, necessary to settle or defend
    such claim. Vidyo agrees to pay all damages and costs finally awarded
    against Customer attributable to such claim. The foregoing states the
    sole liability of Vidyo and the exclusive remedy of Customer for any
    infringement of intellectual property rights by the Product or any
    other items provided by Vidyo hereunder.  (b) If the Product or
    Software becomes, or in the opinion of Vidyo may become, the subject
    of a claim of infringement of any third party right, Vidyo may, at
    its option and in its discretion: (i) procure for Customer the right
    to use the Product free of any liability; (ii) replace or modify the
    Product to make it non-infringing; or (iii) repurchase the applicable
    licenses or Products. (c) Customer will defend or settle, at its
    expense, any action brought against Vidyo based upon the claim that
    any modifications to the Product or combination of the Product with
    products infringes or violates any third party right; provided,
    however, that: (i) Vidyo shall notify Customer promptly in writing of
    any such claim; (ii) Vidyo shall not enter into any settlement or
    compromise any such claim without Customer's prior written consent;
    (iii) Customer shall have sole control of any such action and
    settlement negotiations; and (iv) Vidyo shall provide Customer with
    information and assistance, at Customer's request and expense,
    necessary to settle or defend such claim. Customer agrees to pay all
    damages and costs finally awarded against Vidyo attributable to such
    claim. (d)&nbsp;Notwithstanding Subsection (a) above, Vidyo assumes
    no liability hereunder for, and shall have no obligation to defend
    Customer or to pay costs, damages or attorney's fees for, any claim
    based upon any modifications to the Product not provided by Vidyo or
    combination of the Product with other products.</p>
